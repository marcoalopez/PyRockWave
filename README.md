## What is PyRockWave?

PyRockWave is a Python-based tool for reading single-crystal elasticity databases and modelling elastic properties of earth materials (e.g. seismic wave propagation and anisotropy in heterogeneous media). It allows you to create realistic models of the physical properties of rocks or rock units and simulate and illustrate how seismic waves propagate through them. The code is designed in a modular way to facilitate its development and the interaction with other codes.

PyRockWave is still under heavy development (alpha state), so the functionality may be subject to major changes that break retrocompatibility, and there is no installation guide or specific documentation on how to use it yet. In any case, the code is (and always will be) open source and free, so even though there is no official release and very little documentation, you can have fun with it at your own risk.

## How to contribute to this project?

The GitHub website hosting the project provides several options (you will need a GitHub account, itâ€™s free!):

- Open a [discussion](https://github.com/marcoalopez/PyRockWave/discussions): This is a place to:
  - Ask questions you are wondering about.
  - Share ideas.
  - Engage with the developers (still just me).
- Open and [issue](https://github.com/marcoalopez/PyRockWave/issues): This is a place to track bugs or requests for specific features on the notebooks.
- Create a [pull request](https://github.com/marcoalopez/PyRockWave/pulls): You modified, corrected or added a feature to one of the notebooks and send it for one of the developers to review it and add it to the main page.

Besides, if you want to contribute to the project, you might want to glimpse at the [code of conduct](https://github.com/marcoalopez/strength_envelopes/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) (TLDR: be nice to others ðŸ˜‰).
