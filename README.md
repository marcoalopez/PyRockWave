## What is PyRockWave and how to use it?

PyRockWave is a set of Python codes for reading single-crystal elasticity databases and calculating and plot elastic properties in rocks using averaging schemes (e.g. elastic wave propagation, seismic anisotropy, etc). It is in early development so there is no official release or documentation although the code is open to the public.
