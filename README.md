## How to contribute to this project?

The GitHub website hosting the project provides several options (you will need a GitHub account, itâ€™s free!):

- Open a [discussion](https://github.com/marcoalopez/strength_envelopes/discussions): This is a place to:
  - Ask questions you are wondering about.
  - Share ideas.
  - Engage with the developers (still just me).
- Open and [issue](https://github.com/marcoalopez/strength_envelopes/issues): This is a place to track bugs or requests for specific features on the notebooks.
- Create a [pull request](https://github.com/marcoalopez/strength_envelopes/pulls): You modified, corrected or added a feature to one of the notebooks and send it for one of the developers to review it and add it to the main page.

For a quick explanation see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8OAwrcMlRw. Besides, if you want to contribute to the project, you might want to glimpse at the [code of conduct](https://github.com/marcoalopez/strength_envelopes/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) (TLDR: be nice to others ðŸ˜‰).
