# Function definitions
def voigt_average(elastic_tensors, volume_fractions):
    """Calculates the Voigt average of a set of mineral
    phases, described by their elastic tensors and
    volume fractions.

    The Voigt average is defined as the weighted arithmetic
    mean of elastic tensors, that is:

    C_ij_voigt = Î£_n (F_n * C_nij)

    This can be calculated using Einstein summation (np.einsum)
    using the notation 'n, nij -> ij' where:
    'n' represents the array with the volume fractions, F_n
    'nij' represents the elastic tensors 3-d array, C_nij
    'ij' represents the output array, 2-d array

    Parameters
    ----------
    elastic_tensors : numpy array, shape(n, 6, 6)
        elastic tensors of constitutive phases for
        which to calculate the Voigt average.
    volume_fractions : numpy array, shape(n,)
        Fraction of each constitutive phase in the
        composite material.

    Returns
    -------
    Cij_voigt : numpy array, shape(6, 6)
        Voigt average elastic tensor for the composite
        material.
